				<p>    Postdoc at CERDI (https://cerdi.uca.fr/). Loving it here.

						Similarly loved my time visiting GATE lab in Lyon where I finished my phd in 2024. I find that at CERDI/GATE and in Europe more broadly, there's a large number of really strong phd candidates and friendly post-docs. For someone coming from a small pond, it's every bit as intimidating as it is inspiring!
