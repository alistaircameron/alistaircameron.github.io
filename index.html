				<p>    Postdoc at <a href="https://cerdi.uca.fr/">CERDI</a>. Loving it here.

						Similarly loved my time visiting <a href="https://www.gate.cnrs.fr/">GATE</a> lab in Lyon where I finished my phd in 2024. I find that at CERDI/GATE and in Europe more broadly, there's a large number of really strong phd candidates and friendly post-docs. For someone coming from a small pond, it's quite intimidating!
