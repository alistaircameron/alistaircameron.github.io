        Econ and academia more generally is known to be a place where sexual misconduct goes unpunished.  <span style="font-family: monospace;">creeps</span>  is a small contribution to combatting this trend. It allows latex users to quickly and easily identify authors in their .bib files who have been sanctioned for sexual misconduct by their institution. To do so, it matches your .bib file entries to the <a href="https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org">ASMD database</a> (and so currently only picks up US institutions).
        <br><br>
        
        tldr; here's a <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/project/65916a0c9f98ad02ee07be00">minimum working example</a>.
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Expected Behaviour</h2>
        
        If you do not cite someone who is matched to an individual in the database, <b>nothing will happen</b>. If an author is matched to someone in the database, a message will be printed, showing you who it is, which articles you're citing in which they're an author, and a link to the case.

    A few lines that force in-text citation ordering to be alphabetical (chronological), details on  <a href="https://github.com/alistaircameron/alpha_chrono">github</a>.   

    <br><br>

    One of my phd supervisors (it wasn't Lata and it wasn't Paulo. It wasn't Yaping either...) made me change between alphabetical and chronological ordering of my in-text citations every other week. It got to the point where I just automated it, apparently other supervisors enjoy inflicting this type of torture on others too, coz people asked me to share it.
